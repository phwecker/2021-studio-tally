### 🛠️ Automation Scripts (5 scripts)

All scripts are executable and located in `scripts/`:

1. **deploy-to-pi.sh** - Automated rsync deployment from Mac → Pi
2. **install-tally.sh** - Complete system installation on Pi
3. **configure-device.sh** - Interactive device configuration
4. **setup-kiosk.sh** - Kiosk mode automation
5. **tally.service** - Systemd service definition

### 📝 Templates

- **tally.config.template.json** - Configuration template for quick copying

## 🚀 How to Use This Package

### ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Static IP Configuration Required

**This network does NOT provide DHCP.** You MUST configure a static IP address BEFORE first boot.

### Deploying Your First Device

**Step 0: Pre-Boot Configuration (REQUIRED)**

Before inserting SD card into Pi:

```bash
# 1. Flash Raspberry Pi OS Lite to SD card
# 2. Re-insert SD card into computer
# 3. Create SSH enable file
touch /Volumes/bootfs/ssh

# 4. Create static IP configuration file
nano /Volumes/bootfs/dhcpcd.conf
# Add:
# interface eth0
# static ip_address=192.168.10.171/24
# static routers=192.168.10.1
# static domain_name_servers=192.168.10.1 8.8.8.8

# 5. Eject SD card, insert into Pi, boot, wait 60 seconds
```

**Then proceed with deployment:**

```bash
# 1. From your Mac, in the project directory
./pi-deployment/scripts/deploy-to-pi.sh
# Enter the static IP you configured: 192.168.10.171

# 2. SSH to the Pi
ssh pi@192.168.10.171

# 3. Install everything
/tmp/tally-scripts/install-tally.sh

# 4. Configure device settings
/tmp/tally-scripts/configure-device.sh
# Enter: Camera ID (1), confirm Static IP (192.168.10.171), etc.

# 5. Reboot
sudo reboot
```

**Done!** After reboot, the tally display will automatically show in fullscreen.

### Deploying Additional Devices

Repeat ALL steps (including Step 0) for each additional camera, changing:

- **Static IP in dhcpcd.conf**: .172, .173, .174...
- **Camera/Input ID**: 2, 3, 4...
- **Hostname**: tally-cam2, tally-cam3, tally-cam4...

## ✅ What Each Device Will Do Automatically

After deployment, each Raspberry Pi will:

1. ✅ Boot up automatically when powered
2. ✅ Connect to network with static IP
3. ✅ Start the tally backend service
4. ✅ Connect to ATEM switcher (192.168.10.240)
5. ✅ Launch Chromium in kiosk mode (fullscreen)
6. ✅ Display the tally interface at http://localhost:8081
7. ✅ Update display colors based on camera status:
   - 🔴 RED = ON AIR (program)
   - 🟢 GREEN = UP NEXT (preview)
   - 🟡 YELLOW = IN TRANSITION
   - 🟣 MAGENTA = SUPERSOURCE
   - ⚫ GRAY = NOT SELECTED

## 📊 Deployment Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Single Camera Setup

Perfect for testing or small productions:

- Deploy to 1 Raspberry Pi
- Configure for Camera 1 (Input 1)
- Connect to ATEM
- Test all tally states

### Scenario 2: Multi-Camera Studio

Production environment with multiple cameras:

- Deploy to 4-8 Raspberry Pis
- Each configured for different input (1-8)
- All connect to same ATEM switcher
- Each display shows independent tally status

### Scenario 3: Distributed Setup

Multiple locations or rooms:

- Deploy to Raspberry Pis at different locations
- All connected via network to central ATEM
- Each location sees its own camera status
- Centralized control from ATEM

## 🔍 Verification Steps

After each deployment, verify:

1. **Physical**: Display shows camera number and status
2. **Network**: Pi accessible via static IP
3. **Services**: Both tally and kiosk services running
4. **ATEM**: Color changes when switching camera states
5. **Auto-start**: Reboot works and system comes back up

## 🆘 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Can't SSH to Pi

**Solution**: Ensure `ssh` file was created in boot partition before first boot

### Issue: Script won't run

**Solution**: Make scripts executable: `chmod +x /tmp/tally-scripts/*.sh`

### Issue: Wrong camera number shown

**Solution**: Edit `/opt/tally/tally-backend/config/tally.config.json` and restart service

### Issue: Display not fullscreen

**Solution**: Check kiosk service: `sudo systemctl status kiosk.service`

### Issue: No color changes

**Solution**: Verify ATEM connection: `ping 192.168.10.240`

## 📈 Scaling to Multiple Devices

For deploying 5+ devices efficiently:

1. **Prepare SD cards** - Flash all at once using Pi Imager
2. **Create spreadsheet** - Track IPs, hostnames, input IDs
3. **Deploy in parallel** - Set up multiple devices simultaneously
4. **Use checklist** - Print one per device
5. **Test systematically** - Verify each device before moving to next

## 🎓 Learning Resources

All documentation is self-contained, but here's the recommended reading order:

1. Start → **QUICK_START.md** (for immediate deployment)
2. Reference → **DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md** (when you need details)
3. Verify → **DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md** (for each device)
4. Troubleshoot → **README.md** (when issues arise)

## 🔒 Security Considerations

The deployment includes security recommendations:

- Change default passwords
- Use SSH keys
- Keep system updated
- Consider firewall rules
- Use dedicated user accounts

See DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md Security Notes section for details.

## 🎉 Success Criteria

You'll know your deployment is successful when:

✅ Pi boots automatically  
✅ Backend service shows "active (running)"  
✅ Display shows correct camera number  
✅ Colors change with ATEM switcher states  
✅ System requires no manual intervention  
✅ Rebooting works flawlessly  
✅ Multiple devices work independently

## 📞 Next Steps

Now that you have all the deployment resources:

1. **Read QUICK_START.md** - Understand the 5-step process
2. **Prepare your first Pi** - Flash OS, enable SSH
3. **Run deploy-to-pi.sh** - Copy files from Mac
4. **Follow the prompts** - Let the scripts do the work
5. **Verify operation** - Test all tally states
6. **Scale up** - Deploy additional devices as needed

## 🏆 You're Ready!

Everything you need to deploy production-ready Raspberry Pi tally appliances is now in the `pi-deployment/` directory. The scripts are tested, the documentation is complete, and the process is streamlined.
