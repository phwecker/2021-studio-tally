# ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Order of Operations

## The Studio Network Has NO Internet Access!

**This is the most important thing to understand about deployment:**

The studio network (192.168.10.x subnet) does NOT provide:

- DHCP (no automatic IP assignment)
- Internet access (no package downloads, no apt updates)

## Two-Phase Deployment Strategy

### Phase 1: Internet-Connected Network (TEMPORARY)

‚úÖ **Boot Pi on a network WITH internet access**
‚úÖ **Complete ALL installations while on this network**

```
1. Flash SD card with Raspberry Pi OS Lite
2. Enable SSH (create empty 'ssh' file in boot partition)
3. Boot Pi on YOUR MAIN NETWORK (with DHCP and internet)
4. Find Pi's temporary IP address
5. SSH into Pi: ssh pi@<temporary-ip>
6. Change default password: passwd
7. System updates: sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
8. Install dependencies: sudo apt install -y nodejs npm git chromium-browser xserver-xorg x11-xserver-utils xinit openbox unclutter
9. Deploy files from Mac: ./pi-deployment/scripts/deploy-to-pi.sh
10. Install application: /tmp/tally-scripts/install-tally.sh
    (This installs npm packages - REQUIRES INTERNET!)
```

### Phase 2: Studio Network (FINAL)

‚úÖ **Configure static IP**
‚úÖ **Move Pi to studio network**
‚úÖ **Configure device settings**

```
11. Configure static IP using raspi-config:
    sudo raspi-config ‚Üí Advanced Options ‚Üí Network Config ‚Üí NetworkManager ‚Üí Reboot
    sudo nmtui ‚Üí Edit connection ‚Üí Manual ‚Üí 192.168.10.171/24
12. Reboot: sudo reboot
13. PHYSICALLY DISCONNECT from internet network
14. PHYSICALLY CONNECT to studio network
15. Wait ~30 seconds
16. SSH to static IP: ssh pi@192.168.10.171
17. Configure device: /tmp/tally-scripts/configure-device.sh
18. Final reboot: sudo reboot
```

## What Happens If You Do It Wrong

‚ùå **If you configure static IP FIRST:**

- Pi moves to studio network (no internet)
- `apt update` fails
- `apt install` fails
- `npm install` fails
- Frontend build fails
- YOU'RE STUCK - have to start over or manually transfer packages

‚úÖ **If you install FIRST (correct order):**

- All packages download successfully
- Everything installs properly
- Static IP configuration is last step
- Pi works perfectly on studio network

## Quick Reference Card

### Phase 1: On Internet Network

- [ ] Flash SD card
- [ ] Enable SSH
- [ ] Boot on internet-connected network with DHCP
- [ ] Find temporary IP
- [ ] SSH in
- [ ] Change password
- [ ] `apt update && upgrade`
- [ ] `apt install` dependencies
- [ ] Deploy files from Mac
- [ ] Run `install-tally.sh` (npm install happens here!)

### Phase 2: Move to Studio Network

- [ ] Configure static IP with raspi-config/nmtui
- [ ] Reboot
- [ ] Disconnect from internet network
- [ ] Connect to studio network
- [ ] SSH to static IP
- [ ] Run `configure-device.sh`
- [ ] Final reboot

## IP Address Assignments

Studio network static IPs:

- Camera 1: 192.168.10.171
- Camera 2: 192.168.10.172
- Camera 3: 192.168.10.173
- Camera 4: 192.168.10.174
- Camera 5: 192.168.10.175
- Camera 6: 192.168.10.176
- Camera 7: 192.168.10.177
- Camera 8: 192.168.10.178

Network settings:

- Gateway: 192.168.10.1
- DNS: 192.168.10.1, 8.8.8.8
- Subnet: /24 (255.255.255.0)
- ATEM Switcher: 192.168.10.240

## Remember

üî¥ **Internet-dependent tasks MUST happen BEFORE configuring static IP**
üü¢ **Device-specific configuration happens AFTER moving to studio network**

The key insight: Your studio network is isolated (good for security/performance) but this requires a two-phase deployment strategy.
